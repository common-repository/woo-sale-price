== Description ==

= EN =
When you sell a product at a reduced price by WooCommerce, you want to show to the customer the applied discount, calculated by subtracting the sale price from the regular price.
This plugin let you shows that discount not only in the cart, as to say before the purchase, but even after, in orders, notices, invoices, etc. because it records, inside the WooCommerce order, the discount applied in that moment.

= IT =
Quando vendi un prodotto a un prezzo scontato su WooCommerce, vuoi mostrare al cliente lo sconto applicato, calcolato sottraendo il prezzo ridotto dal prezzo normale.
Questo plugin ti consente di mostrare lo sconto non solo nel carrello, cioè prima dell'acquisto, ma anche dopo, negli ordini, negli avvisi, nelle fatture, ecc., perché registra, all'interno dell'ordine WooCommerce, lo sconto applicato in quel momento.
